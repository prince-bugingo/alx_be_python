#Simple interest rate formula/ (I=P*R*T)
#( I ) is the interest earned,
#( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
#( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
#( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.


#Define
P = 1000
R = 0.05
T = 3
interest = P*R*T
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
